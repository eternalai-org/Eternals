# EternalAI Agent

EternalAI Agent is a conversational agent that can perform various tasks using a combination of toolsets and language models. The agent can be configured to execute multiple missions, each with its own set of toolsets and language models.

## Prerequisites
In this project, we tested with ***Python 3.10.0***, but it should work with any version of Python 3.10.x or higher.

## Installation

Set up the project environment using one of the methods below: **Conda** or **Pip**.

### Using Conda

1. **Create a Conda Environment**

    ```bash
    conda create -n eternalai_agents python=3.10.0
    ```

2. **Activate the Conda Environment:**

    ```bash
    conda activate eternalai_agents
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    Navigate to the project directory and run:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Using Pip
If you prefer to use Pip without Conda, simply navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup and Configuration

To get started, follow the steps below to configure the project:
### **1. Configuration File**

A sample configuration file, [**eternal.json**](configs/eternal.json), is provided in the configs directory. You can customize this file to fit your specific requirements.

2. **Environment Variables**

To get started, you'll need to configure your environment variables. Here's a step-by-step guide:

### Step 1: Create a new `.env` file

A sample environment file, [.env-example](.env-example), is located in the root directory. Create a new `.env` file by copying the contents of `.env-example`:

### Step 2: Modify the `.env` file

Modify the values in the `.env` file to match your environment settings.

**Available Environment Variables**:
- **`IS_SANDBOX`**: Set to **`0`** for production or **`1`** for sandbox mode.

- **`ETERNAL_BACKEND_API`**: Set to the URL of your contract-based LLM backend API.

- **`ETERNAL_BACKEND_API_APIKEY`**: Set to your API key for the contract-based LLM backend API.

- **`ETERNAL_X_API`**: Set to the URL of your Twitter API.

- **`ETERNAL_X_API_APIKEY`**: Set to your API key for the Twitter API.

Example `.env` file:

```bash
# Environment
IS_SANDBOX=0

# for contract based llm
ETERNAL_BACKEND_API=https://api.eternalai.org
ETERNAL_BACKEND_API_APIKEY=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE

# twitter api
ETERNAL_X_API=https://agent.api.eternalai.org/api/developer
ETERNAL_X_API_APIKEY=PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE
```
